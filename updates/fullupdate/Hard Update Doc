This directory will always contain the code for the most up to date version of the suite. It will replace the current
local version of the suite. We classify our updates into two categories. Soft and hard. A soft update only updates files
that the suite uses, it doesn't replace the suite. A hard update will replace the suite with a newer version. Soft updates are
signified through version number, while hard updates are signified through version name. Both will be checked on boot. 
We've already described how soft updates will be performed within the README file in the updates directory. Hard updates will
be checked on boot as well, if they are accepted, it will ask the user to enter 'nbsupdate' to begin the update. If they are
refused, offline mode will be forced.

That's all we have to say about hard updates for now. 
Happy hacking!
