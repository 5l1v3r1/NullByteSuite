This file will be used to update the repoistory contents file. Upon update, it will be pulled, parsed of this header, and cross
referenced with the users current local contents. If there are any modules listed in local contents that are also listed 
in the updated-repo file, they are removed from the updated-repo file, as they are already contained locally. Any remaining
modules will be written to the repo contents file.
