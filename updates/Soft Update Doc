This file will outline what these files and directories are for, and how they will operate. 

To start, there are two categories of updates, soft and hard. For information on hard updates, see the 'Hard Update Doc' file
in the 'fullupdate' directory. This file will only outline the soft updates.

checkup file:
  This file will be used to check for updates. It contains the current version number. This file will be pulled, read, and the
  version number will be cross referenced with the current version number stored in the 'vinfo' file locally. If they match,
  there are no updates. If they don't match, an update will be prompted. If this prompt is accepted, the other files in this 
  directory will be used to update the local files. For specific information on each files purpose, see that files section of this
  readme.
  
  
updated-banners:
  This file will contain the updated banners. It will be pulled, read, and it's contents will overwrite the existing contents
  with no cross references.
  

updated-repo:
  This file will contain the updated contents for the 'repocontents' file. It will be pulled, read, and cross referenced with
  the 'localcontents' file. If a module found in local contents is also in the updated-repo file, it will be removed from the
  updated-repo file. This file will then overwrite the current repocontents file. This will grant the user access to any new
  modules that are added to the repository.


That's all the documentation on soft updates we have for now.
Happy Hacking!
