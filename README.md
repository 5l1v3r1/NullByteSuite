# NullByteSuite
This is the repository for the Null-Byte suite to pull tools from.

This will be the repository to store non-local tools. If a tool is requested that is not stored locally, the user will be
prompted that a set of wget commands will be launched and the selected module will be pulled down from the dedicated
repository, happy hacking!
