This is a threaded port scanner written in Python.

It works by sending SYN packets and waiting for responses. A SYN-ACK means the port is open, RST-ACK means the port is closed. Threading is used to scan as fast as possible.

Please note that the SERVICE column only shows what the port is commonly used for, not what the service actually is!

TARGET - IP of target.
PORT_RANGE - Ports to scan. Use single ports separated by commas (No spaces!), and/or port ranges, eg. 1,50,100-1000,8342
PING - Set to "false" to skip pinging the target.

This module has been written by Joe Schmoe.
WARNING - This module was built for speed, it will make A LOT of noise!
