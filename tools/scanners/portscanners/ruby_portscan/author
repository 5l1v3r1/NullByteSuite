This is a socket port scanner written in Ruby! It works by attempting a
socket connection to every port in the given range. A successful connection
means an open port.

The RHOST must be the target IP address.
The MINPORT must be the start port.
The MAXPORT must be the stop port.

This module was developed by Defalt!
